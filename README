Project Name: BroGL
Language: C++
Platform: Windows
Description: Open source, object-oriented, software graphics rendering engine 
			 for education. The project will be implemented over N milestones.
			 Each new milestone will represent a new version of the engine.

% Milestons
Milestone 1: Basic Rendering
Description: The first iteration of the engine should be able to render basic
			 geometry. This will include representation of 3D geometric
			 primitives, modeling, transformation, and basic rasterization.

Milestone 2: Culling and Clipping
Description: In this phase, back-face culling and view clipping capabilities
			 will be added. 

Milestone 3: Lighting
Description: Illumination is an advanced topic which makes this milestone one
			 of the most involved. A basic lighting implementation is all that
			 is required for this phase. In milestone 5, many optimizations
			 will be added.

Milestone 4: Texturing and shading
Description: Simple textures and shading, per-pixel.

Milestone 5: Optimizations
Description: Any additional features or performance issues will be addressed
			 during this milestone.
