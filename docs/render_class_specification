Class Methods - Not extensive
% Ultimately, the view is rendered after all scenes are loaded
RenderView

% Given all of the objects (world, entity, etc.), generate the surfaces to be
% drawn for the given frame. The projection setup is also called here.
GenerateDrawSurfaces

% After the frame has been generated, pass all of the vertices of the view to
% this method. Send the points to OpenGL for displaying in the current window.
DrawPolygon

% Create the projection matrix necessary for rendering this view properly from
% the observer's perspective.
